To run this app run node app.js in the terminal. The terminal will prompt the user to type one of the selectors and once the user types an appropriate prompt the terminal will return a list of the corresponding JSON of the selected views as well as the number of items in the list. Although, I've worked with JavaScript this was my first time working in Node and it was fun to research ways to input and output info using the terminal with the Readline function. I'm looking forward to getting feedback on my app, and exploring how to include the ability for users to select some of the more complex compound selectors.
